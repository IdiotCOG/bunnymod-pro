# PLEASE NOTE #

I wrote Bunnymod Pro as I was learning C++ and how HLSDK works, so there's exceptionally awful code here and there (like transferring the grenade time and gauss charge by *setting console variables*). The most recent stuff that is not as awful is in input.cpp in the HL-TAS-Mod branch (which is where the most of the TASmod recides), as well as in other files added in that branch.
